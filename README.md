## Project Overview:
This repository contains our team's final project for the Programming for Data Science course. Our project involves analyzing a Stroke Prediction to extract meaningful insights and build predictive models. We have applied various data science techniques including EDA, data preprocessing, questions and analysis, feature selection, model preaparation, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset Description:
The dataset used in this project includes various features related to the problem we are addressing. The data is collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/data) and includes the following columns:

- **id**: id of each patient
- **gender**: each patient's gender can be male, female and other
- **age**: how old is each patient
- **hypertension**: when the pressure in blood is too high
- **heart_disease**:  when the patient have disease relates to heart
- **ever_married**: whether the patient is or used to be married
- **work_type**: the job status of the patient
- **Residence_type**: the area that patients live
- **avg_glucose_level**: the level of sugar in the blood
- **bmi**: measure of body fat based on height and weight
- **smoking_status**: whether the patient is smoking or not
- **stroke**: whether the patient got stroke or not

## Purpose:
This dataset can be used for a variety of analyses:

- **Feature Selection**: Identify the most important features (bmi, smoking status, heart disease, ...) that contribute to the stroke possibility.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to predict stroke possibility.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform statistical analysis to understand the relationships between different features.

## Potential Analyses Include:
- Investigating the impact of different features on stroke possibility.
- Performing exploratory data analysis to uncover hidden patterns of chance getting stroke.

## Project Structure:
- **data/**: Contains the datasets used in the project.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- **reports/**: Generated reports and visualizations.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. Choose the appropriate kernel.

## Usage:
- To run the script:
    + Press `run all` .
    + If there are some libraries not included in your kernel, please run command prompt and write `pip install required-library`.

## Project Management:
We are using Jira for project management. You can track our progress and view our backlog on our [Jira Board](https://truongthuankiet1990.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/DSPROG/boards/1/backlog).
